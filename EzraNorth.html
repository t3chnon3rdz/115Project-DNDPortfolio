                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>Ezra north is an archaeologist who worked at his family's digsite for a number of years. As the North family is part of the cardinal directions of research in Faerun, their study of the esoteric came with a great deal of studying the ancient and long-lost forgotten. Though the North family is no more, Ezra carries on his family's legacy on his shoulders as a heavy burden and hopes to one day bring back his family from whence they perished. Though Ezra is terrified to utilize his newfound powers, he's skilled with firearms and uses them in order to defend himself on his newfound adventure.</p>
                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>Ezra was born into the North family on the 3rd of Alturiak during a snowstorm atop the North Manor. From then on, Ezra had an exceptionally comfortable childhood growing up, though he kept to the prospective wishes of his family and their area of study. From age 5 onwards, Ezra began his studies on the esoteric and otherworldly while also homeschooling himself on the different subjects the worlds had to offer. He learned about Agriculture whenever the East Family would send members to their house, and biology from the West's. Math and careful calculations would be rare from the South family, but Ezra would be just as excited to get visits from them growing up, cherishing the company of the four houses like they were a part of his own family.</p>
                <p>At the age of 11, Ezra went on his first expedition into the Hordelands (commonly known as the Endless Wastes) to an archaeology site that his father was tending. During the 6 month expedition, his father came down with a terrible sickness that left him bedridden for weeks. Though he managed to overcome that sickness, Ezra had to step up at a young age in order to tend to the dig site with multiple other researchers through the ever-shifting climates of the region. Through the mixture of snow and blazing desert, like someone was flicking a switch, Ezra worked tirelessly through the blazing temperatures and frigid air until the mud was all he knew. This never dissuaded him from the excitement of ancient discovery though, and instead left Ezra more starry-eyed at the potential for the ancient than ever before. They discovered ancient ruins towards the end of that expedition that was buried under the hundreds and thousands of years of shifting climate and landscape, and as Ezra was one of the first to discover the entrance of a buried citadel, the team and his father named these ruins to the “North Star Excavation Site”.</p>
                <p>From that point on, Ezra studied the ancient history of the Hordelands as well as he could, believing that this could be his true step into the North Family legacy. Ezra kept up with his general studies and busied his time with his pet project, and when his 19th birthday came around, he was allowed to gather up his own expedition for his first trip of his own. He took upon a group of 7 archaeologists and 2 mercenaries for the trip and headed out to the North Star Citadel. Though his father has worked at this site for many years after the discovery of these ruins, Ezra kept a close eye on all the research documents and papers that came through the North household, believing there had to be more to the ruins than they initially thought. Ezra stayed at this site for around 4 years, sending team members back and forth so they could be close to their families and introducing newer ones to the site and the history he discovered. Ezra preferred younger recruits for this as they had a more outward curiosity towards the ancient, and despite being about the same age as many of them, felt like a team leader in his respective environment. Two archaeologists and one mercenary stuck with Ezra during his 4-year expedition: ___ ___ and ___.</p>
                <p>By the end of the expedition, Ezra and the newest archaeology team discovered a channel of floors leading below the citadel by accident, leading a good couple hundred feet below layers of mutating frost and sand and earth and stone. At the bottom was a perfectly spherical room that cascaded downwards into an empty chamber. At the bottom of this chamber were pieces of a cracked stone tablet that were inscribed with a language and writing style that wasn't recognized in the North household's years of study. This was it. This was the breakthrough Ezra hoped for. He decided that this tablet must hold the secrets of the Hordelands and brought the tablet back with him, declaring that he would be packing up within the week's time. There was a celebration for this with what little rations they had of alcohol and food, and a small feast took place. Ezra headed back on the long journey home while his friends stayed behind.</p>
                <p>Over the course of the next 2 years, with help from the East household's knowledge of social cues, dialects, and language history, Ezra managed to translate the fragmented tablet. It spoke of a knowledge and truth about the universe that felt alien in nature to understand, but it only drove Ezra's curiosity forward. It laid down bare-bones instructions on uncovering the truth, and it took a couple months to procure materials from the world to begin this 'ritual' the tablet described. However, when Ezra attempted this ritual at the age of 25, he gathered the members of the North Household, his brothers and sisters and parents and aunts and uncles, and brought them into the main foyer of the house so he can reveal his findings.</p>
                <p>The ritual was a disaster. It started off with a singularity appearing in the center of the room, completely transparent but the energy coming off of it could be felt with ease. And then it grew, larger and larger consuming any material in its path. Ezra's brother was first, disappearing painlessly. Silently. Bit by bit until he was consumed. The rest of the family panicked and Ezra tried to put a stop to it, but the singularity grew bigger and bigger, consuming his family one by one, and his house. As the cliffside and supports of the house were lost to the singularity and Ezra's veins blackened with whatever vile energy this ritual produced, he fell into Lake Mulsantir, falling from great heights as he watched the house disappear before his eyes.</p>
                <p>Ezra woke up off the lake coast by the city of Mulsantir, discovered only by some local fishermen that existed there. He was gripping a shard of obsidian that was incredibly jagged to the touch. Panicked he left it there in the sand, panicking from his recent 'nightmare', only to watch as the sword disappeared from his view as though it was never there to begin with. From there, Ezra traveled home after gathering what little belongings he had on him to find some answers, but after the day-long trip, he only found a perfectly spherical crater upon which his manor used to stand. </p>
                <p>Distraught and in a spiral of despair, Ezra decided to make his trip to the South household with the little knowledge he knows of their research of other realms to potentially help him. It took him over half a year just to travel to see the South family, though they were of little help to Ezra's situation. He never let on what actually happened that night, but described circumstances of otherworldly magic in the hopes that he may not be seen as a murderer but simply as a man who has lost their family due to something not of their control. </p>
                <p>Ezra spent around 19 months within the south household, coping with his grief as best as he could, and distracting himself with helping the South family with their own research. He never learned the intricacies of what they did, but Ezra was taught about devices called “Firearms” and learned of how they can turn a weak man into a powerful soldier with ease. Though there was little knowledge of how they worked, Ezra learned to use them, as though he had a peaceful life once, he knew that his luck in the world had run dry, and whatever form of protection he could bring to himself, he would. It was the night of his last stay within the south household when he had an epiphany; what if I could bring them back? He never saw anyone die, what if that singularity was a portal if anything else? Whether it was a hope wrapped around the confines of grief and potential delusions, he had to hold onto it. Before daylight hit the South household, Ezra left, taking one of the firearms and a handful of ammunition. He followed trails of knowledge and inklings until he made it to the great library of Candlekeep. He didn't stay long but did what little research he could on otherworldly travel before leaving to Waterdeep to pick up more coin to fund his newest expedition.</p>
