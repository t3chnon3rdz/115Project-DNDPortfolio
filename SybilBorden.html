                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>Sybil Borden is known as one of the saviours of Osreah after he and his party proceeded to defeat a horde of undead that attacked the city under the commands of the lich Umalok. Though Sybil had a massive hand in the restoration efforts of the city, he is better known as the cleric with a thousand eyes, named so after the several different eyeballs the pock his left arm. These eyeballs, Sybil says, is the god he worships known as the Ceaseless Watcher. This deity is supposedly all knowing and feeds Sybil the knowledge he requires in order to do good in the word, though there are rumors that this 'deity' has other intentions yet to be known...</p>
                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>Sybil was born into poverty within the city of Osreah to his mother Lilian Border and his father Maxwell Borden. They grew up as petty market thieves on the city streets, fighting every day to survive for the next measly scrap they could find. During this time, Sybil learned many tricks of the trade and avoided the ire of the law that patrolled the city, becoming quite adept at pickpocketing merchants that came in through the docks. It didn't take long however for Sybil to meet his match. At some point, Sybil stole a jade amulet from a mysterious merchant that came in through a ship made of charred wood. Though he dealt with quite the chase, Sybil managed to shake them, and he stood on the outskirts of town for a long while after to be sure he wouldn't be caught. When he determined it was safe enough to go back, Sybil wandered back into the city and into his shelter down one of the dark alleyways dotting the city. When he turned the last corner to home, he saw the cloaked merchant standing above the deceased bodies of his parents with the scent of fresh blood filling the streets. Sybil ran as fast as he could to save himself, and in the process tripped and fell down a flight of stairs, cracking the glass gem in the center of the jade amulet. This released whatever was trapped inside, and over the next few days, Sybil fell into a heavy fever where thoughts that weren't his flooded his brain. After 2 weeks, Sybil made a miraculous recovery, though found his arm to be filled with different eyeballs of creatures he never knew. From this point on, he found himself with divine powers and thought to use them for good where he could, putting the murder of his parents behind him and his new righteous path ahead. </p>
                <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
                <ul class="funFacts">
                    <li>Sybil's favourite food is shortbread cookies, as it was a treat he often stole from the bakery in town.</li>
                    <li>At one point during his adventures, Sybil took on a juvenile copper dragon on his own in a tournament and defeated it single-handedly.</li>
                    <li>Though Sybil doesn't fully understand his condition, the eyeballs pocked into his arm are a parasitic god known only as the Ceaseless Watcher, and what has infected him is only a small fragment of what's to come...</li>
