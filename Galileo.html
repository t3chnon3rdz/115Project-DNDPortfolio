                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>Born on the remote island of the fey Varalia, Galileo was born beneath a lunar eclipse. People grant this as reason to his odd ability and mentality. Galileo is a pygmy owlin, and the smallest of his kind, though he's known as a reliable and kindhearted warrior amongst his people. His main abilities include being able to view every potential future ahead of him and the infinite possibilites it brings, though he finds it difficult to figure out which reality will happen next. His secondary ability is to temporarily pluck another version of himself from another timeline to help fight with him. This ability has been used to take down an ancient demon that lurked in the dark past of Varalia before.</p>
                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>Galileo was always an oddball growing up in the thriving society of the fey, but as his parents were knights who protected the island, he held the same dream close to his little heart. This allowed him to push forward through academy and training despite his incredibly small frame. Galileo made many many friends along the way, and always gave everyone a bright smile despite seeing so many innumerable futures for each of them. This brave little bird eventually saved Varalia from human invaders far into the future, leading to an independence within the island and recognition from the empire union on the mainland.</p>
