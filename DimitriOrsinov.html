                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>Very little is known about the mountain of a man Dimitri Orsinov. His more known adventure was with a small band of mercenaries who were tasked by an organization known as the "Dragon's Dogma", a group tasked in hunting down dragons causing trouble throughout the world. Dimitri tends to fight with a greatsword that rivals many, and fights with the strength of 10 men. Some have even said that Dimitri can teleport in order to take care of his enemies, though if that is the case, none have ever lived to see it. In his free time, Dimitri can be found drinking bars out of all their stock, and those that have dared compete in drinking games with him have described him as being the funniest half-wit they've ever met.</p>
                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>Dimitri was born in the arctic town of [REDACTED] within the military civilization of [REDACTED]. From there he grew up being taught the martial arts of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. Eventually, he went completely AWOL and disappeared from his homeland, wandering around looking for adventure and purpose. Eventually he found mercenary work in cities as they moved down the coast of [REDACTED] where he ended up in the employment of the Dragon's Dogma, hunting dragons and eventually becoming one himself.</p>
