                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>Silas Sorrowgrave is a skilled thief who has died once before when he was used in a terrible ritual to bring back a beast called a Megaloth; a terrifying half-demon creature born of hate and malice. Since finding his place within the army of Astoria, Silas has met many wonderful companions and has used his skills as the previously-deceased to complete his jobs with skilled precision. </p>
                <h3>Background:</h3>
                <p>Not much is known of Silas' early life. Apparently he was on a ship that was looking to carry shipments across continents, but proceeded to come under fire from pirates among the Amaldesian coast. Silas lost his parents that day as he fell overboard, the only thing saving him being a shattered piece of wood that carried him to the small swamp-town of Hamalduke. He was taken in by his caretaker, Eric Sorrowgrave of the Sorrowgrave cemetary. There, he was taught a form of espionage within the high political figures in the heights of the city, as well as taught basic poisons from the many mushrooms growing around the cemetary. Sadly, this skilled craft was cut short, as Silas was caught careless on a mission by one of the drow figures that ran the city. He was taken in and used as a sacrifice to summon a Megaloth, and Silas' still beating heart was removed in front of him. Silas then woke up 40 years later, a literal hole in his chest where his heart should be, healed over entirely. With no memories to mark his past, he set off to make a new life and hopefuly regain the memories he lost.</p>
                <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
                <ul class="funFacts">
                    <li>Silas was one of the first people to invent sweet tea in this world (He taught a wizard to use ice magic on a cup of plain sweetened tea, and it was a hit in his home town).</li>
                    <li>He would every once in a while stick his hand through his chest-hole to prank his friends and gross them out.</li>
                    <li>As he has no need to breathe as an undead, Silas enjoys letting out his breath and sinking to the bottom of ponds to sort of 'meditate' for up to an hour to relax.</li>
